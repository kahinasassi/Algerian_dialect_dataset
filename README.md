# Algerian_dialect_dataset
In recent years, many researchers have made efforts to develop more Arabic resources (Abidi, 2019), such as datasets that enhance the development and evolution of sentiment analysis for the Arabic language. We benefit from this work to design our dataset, it allows us to save time during data collection and diversify the topics covered in the corpus by diversifying data sources. We present in this directory some dataset generated from the research work of the following authors: (Bouamor et al. 2018) for MADAR. (Mataoui et al. 2016) for “Wacht7ass” and (Chader et al. 2019) for Brandt DZ. these dataset are annotated manualy useing crowdsourcing method.
